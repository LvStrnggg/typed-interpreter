# typed-interpreter
An improved version of OW2-asm's BasicInterpreter

# Why?
BasicInterpreter defaults every object type to `java/lang/Object`. I needed these types for a project I'm working on, and
realized this only recently. So I decided to write an improved version, which resolves types in the values. Feel free to use
and tweak however you want.
